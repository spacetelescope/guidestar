Embedding in Confluence
=======================

Wireframe demos can be embedded in Confluence pages as **animated GIFs**.
The GIF is generated automatically from the demo by a headless browser
during the GitHub Actions build — no manual screen recording needed.

.. note::

   Confluence's iframe macro uses ``sandbox="sandbox"`` which blocks all
   JavaScript execution.  For this reason, interactive HTML embeds do
   not work in Confluence.  Animated GIFs are the recommended approach.

   If your platform allows JavaScript in iframes (or you are viewing
   outside Confluence), you can also link directly to the self-contained
   HTML demo pages on GitHub Pages.


How it works
------------

1. **Wireframes** are authored once in ``examples/wireframes/`` —
   these are the layout and styling for your demo UI.

2. **Demo configs** live in ``examples/demos/`` as JSON files.  Each
   config references a wireframe and defines the step sequence:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "wireframe": "kitchen-sink.html",
        "title": "Kitchen Sink — All Built-in Actions",
        "steps": [
          "#btn-sidebar@1800:click",
          "#sidebar@800:toggle-class=open",
          "#input-search@1500:set-value=pipeline"
        ],
        "repeat": true,
        "height": "420px"
      }

   Multiple configs can reference the **same wireframe** with different
   step sequences.

3. **A build script** (``examples/build.py``) combines each config with
   its wireframe and inlines the controller JS and CSS into a single
   self-contained HTML page.

4. **A recording script** (``examples/record.py``) opens each built
   page in headless Chromium, captures frames during one full playback
   cycle, and assembles them into an animated GIF.  Playback controls
   are hidden in the recording.

5. **GitHub Actions** runs both scripts on push and deploys the HTML
   pages and GIFs to GitHub Pages.


Setting up your project
-----------------------

1. Add your wireframe HTML files to ``examples/wireframes/``.

2. Create a JSON config in ``examples/demos/`` for each demo variant.
   See ``examples/demos/kitchen-sink-full.json`` for a complete
   example.

3. Test locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Build self-contained HTML pages
      python examples/build.py

      # Record animated GIFs (requires: pip install playwright Pillow
      # and: playwright install chromium)
      python examples/record.py

      # Check the output
      ls _site/*.html _site/*.gif

4. Push to ``main``.  The ``pages.yml`` workflow builds, records, and
   deploys everything to GitHub Pages automatically.


Embedding in Confluence
-----------------------

Use Confluence's built-in **image macro** to embed the animated GIF:

1. Get the GIF URL from GitHub Pages::

      https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/kitchen-sink-full.gif

2. In Confluence, insert an image by URL (or use the ``!`` image
   macro in wiki markup)::

      !https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/kitchen-sink-full.gif!

The GIF loops automatically and shows the full demo sequence.

For example, the "kitchen-sink-short" demo GIF hosted on GitHub Pages:

.. image:: https://spacetelescope.github.io/guidestar/kitchen-sink-short.gif
   :alt: Kitchen Sink Short — animated GIF demo
   :width: 100%


Linking to the interactive version
----------------------------------

For platforms that allow JavaScript in iframes, you can also link
directly to the self-contained HTML pages:

.. code-block:: text

   https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/kitchen-sink-full.html

These pages include the full interactive demo with play/pause/restart
controls.  You can use them in any context where JavaScript is
permitted (direct links, documentation, non-sandboxed iframes, etc.).


Reusing wireframes with different steps
---------------------------------------

The same wireframe can power multiple demos.  For example:

.. code-block:: text

   examples/
     wireframes/
       kitchen-sink.html          ← one wireframe
     demos/
       kitchen-sink-full.json     ← long demo (all actions)
       kitchen-sink-short.json    ← short demo (highlights only)

Both JSON configs reference ``"wireframe": "kitchen-sink.html"`` but
define different step sequences.  The build script produces a separate
self-contained HTML page and GIF for each.


Demo config reference
---------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 15 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``wireframe``
     - (required)
     - Filename of the wireframe HTML in ``examples/wireframes/``
   * - ``title``
     - ``"Wireframe Demo"``
     - Page ``<title>``
   * - ``steps``
     - ``[]``
     - Array of step shorthand strings or step objects
   * - ``repeat``
     - ``true``
     - Loop the demo on completion
   * - ``autoStart``
     - ``true``
     - Start automatically when visible
   * - ``height``
     - ``"100vh"``
     - Container height in the built page
   * - ``pauseOnInteraction``
     - ``true``
     - Pause on user clicks inside the demo
   * - ``initialClass``
     - ``""``
     - CSS class(es) applied to the content root on load

See :doc:`configuration` for full details on step syntax and options.


Recording options
-----------------

The ``record.py`` script accepts several options:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/record.py --fps 10 --width 800         # defaults
   python examples/record.py --demo kitchen-sink-full      # one demo only
   python examples/record.py --site _site --out _site      # custom dirs

Higher ``--fps`` produces smoother GIFs but larger files.  The default
of 10 fps is a good balance.


Troubleshooting
---------------

**GIF does not appear in Confluence**
   Verify the GitHub Pages URL loads the GIF correctly in a new browser
   tab.  Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in the repo settings
   (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).

**GIF is too large**
   Reduce ``--fps`` (e.g. ``--fps 5``) or ``--width`` (e.g.
   ``--width 600``).  You can also shorten the step sequence — each
   step's delay directly affects the recording duration.

**GIF does not show the full demo**
   The recording duration is calculated from the sum of all step delays
   plus a 1.5 s buffer.  If your demo has very long CSS transitions
   that extend beyond the step delay, increase the relevant step's
   delay.

**Interactive HTML page does not work in Confluence iframe**
   This is expected.  Confluence's iframe macro uses
   ``sandbox="sandbox"`` which blocks JavaScript.  Use the GIF instead.

**Changes aren't reflected**
   GitHub Pages has a CDN cache.  After pushing changes, wait a few
   minutes or append a cache-busting query string to the URL
   (e.g. ``?v=2``).
